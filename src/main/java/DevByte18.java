/*
Max Points
This question is asked by Google. You are given a bag of coins, an initial energy of E , and want to maximize your number of points (which starts at zero). To gain a single point you can exchange coins[i] amount of energy (i.e. if I have 100 energy and a coin that has a value 50 I can exchange 50 energy to gain a point). If you do not have enough energy you can give away a point in exchange for an increase in energy by coins[i] amount (i.e. you give away a point and your energy is increased by the value of that coin: energy += coins[i]). Return the maximum number of points you can gain. Note: Each coin may only be used once.

Ex: Given the following coins and starting energyâ€¦

coins = [100, 150, 200] and E = 150, return 1
coins = [100,200,300,400] and E = 200, return 2
coins = [300] and E = 200, return 0
